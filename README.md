WebAssembly Text Format Syntax Support for Vim
==============================================

[vim-wasm][] provides a [WebAssembly][] filetype `wat` support; syntax, filetype detection, and indentation.
This filetype plugin defines highlights based on [WebAssembly text format spec][].

Now this plugin is included in the [official Vim runtime files][vim runtime dir]. This repository is for
development. Unless you want to use HEAD version, you don't need to install this plugin.

## Installation and Usage

Copy `ftdetect`, `ftplugin`, `indent` and `syntax` directories into your `~/.vim` directory or use your
favorite plugin manager to install.
This plugin automatically detects `*.wat` (and `*.wast`) files as WebAssembly text format.
